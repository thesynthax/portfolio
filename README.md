# 🎛️ thesynthax.space: 3D Interactive Portfolio

This isn’t your usual portfolio website.

It’s a full-on interactive **3D environment**: you don’t scroll through it, you **walk through it**.

And no, I didn’t use Three.js.  
In fact, I did not write **any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript** at all.

Everything you see: the lighting, camera transitions, shaders, UI logic, reflections, and every little animation,
is built entirely in **Unity (C#)**, exported as a **WebGL build**, and then shaped into a fully interactive web experience.

### 💡 Concept

The portfolio is split into two parts:
- **The landscape**: my creative side, representing music, design, and aesthetics.
- **The house**: my technical side, representing software, engineering, and projects.

You can explore both, click interactable objects, and watch the world respond dynamically.  
It’s half game, half experience, and fully personal.

### ⚙️ Stack

- **Engine:** Unity 6 (WebGL)
- **Language:** C#
- **Renderer:** URP (with custom shaders + baked GI)
- **Hosting:** Deployed via GitHub Pages on [**thesynthax.space**](https://thesynthax.space)  
  (served as a PWA, optimized for desktop)

### 🧠 Philosophy

This wasn’t made for clicks.  
It was made to prove that creativity and engineering don’t have to live on separate pages.  
They can, quite literally, share the same world.
